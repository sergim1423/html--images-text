#  $${\color{lightblue}Description\ About\ Project}$$
### In this project it has taught me alot about different HTML tags and their purposes. I learned how to add fonts from Google.
### Also learned how to add, images to the HTML by adding the keyword img src and then the following location of said image. 
### We also learned how to add ids to the page so instead of selecting a whole element and everything that pertains to it such 
### as if I wanted to style an h2 tag but I have multiple of these tags throughout the file. Theres a problem here especially
### if I want each tag to be different. Thats where ids come in and allow for specific changes targeted only towards that id.
### Another thing we learned in this course was how to import videos from Youtube using the embedded code inside of the Youtube
### share button which is called iframe. We learned how to style the imbedded video and how to make it look nice using the tags in css
### called #myVideo iframe. The whole purpose of this project taught us how to use different features in both HTML and CSS. And
### it taught us how to use these two languages together to create a site that can look appealing and function.
