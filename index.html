          Hi there, welcome to my website that will give you a little insight on who I am.</p>
        <p>Im a student at RVCC and im studying Computer Programming.</p>
          <p>I just turned 22 a couple weeks ago and im starting to feel it.</p>
          <p>One thing that is a big part of my life is that im a Christian.</p>
          <p>A lot of my time and effort is spent at church volunteering and helping with whatever is going on.</p>
          <p>Currently we are preparing a Christmas play and that has been going well.</p>
          <p>Some other things about me is that im an avid tea drinker.</p>
          <p>I like my teas and prefer them over coffee any day of the week.</p>
          <p>Another neat fact about me is that I am Moldovian, I know a lot of people don’t know where that is so I will clarify.</p>
          <p>Moldova is a tiny country right under Ukraine.</p>
          <p>The common language over there is Russian so I speak that language also.</p>
          <p>Although I was born in the United States I still claim to be Moldovian because thats where my parents are from.</p>
          <p>I will leave you with one more neat fact about me and that is that, I play the saxophone in a band for my church.</p>
          <p>I have been playing for around 10 years and even though I have all that experience there is still a lot more ways to improve.

        <h2>CSS Sprites</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            The topic im going to write about is CSS Sprites.
            Im going to explain what they are, why to use them and what they look like.
            So first lets start out by explaining what a sprite is.
            A sprite is essentially a combination of multiple images that form one image file for use on a website.
            For example if I have multiple images of the same kind of topic, we can create a sprite by combining these images into a single file.
            And now this single file contains all these images and we can format it nicely.
            To visualize it we can look at this popular example. 
          </p>
          <img src="img/sprite-test.jpg" alt="sprite-img" id="sprite-size" />
          <p>
            We see how there are 3 different flags but its combined to make a single sprite. 
          </p>

          <p>
            The very cool thing about CSS sprites is that although it takes a bit more memory to store these images.
             It very useful in real life application.
              So lets pretend we need a website to load some images.
               If we have multiple images that are large file sizes it will take a bit longer to load to the screen.
                Also there are limitations on how many images a server may take.
          </p>

          <p>
            CSS Sprites fix these issues by creating one file for all these images.
             So the server will be able to load this one big file and save time on the amount of server requests.
              And to access these images we specify the location the coordinates of where these images are.
          </p>

          <p>
           Each image in the file has a set location.
            To be able to see the image on screen we need to type in the location of the specific image we need.
            So for example if we have 3 different images and want to access the first image.
             We would type in the location of said image we want to access. 
          </p>

          <p>
          This is where sprites become super useful and Id say almost crucial in building a website.
           Especially when the goal is to optimize the response of the page and make it load all the information fast and more efficiently.
          </p>

          <p>
           Now that we know what sprites do.
            Lets look at how we can utilize them and how they look like on a website.
             We are going to take the same image of the flags but this time show one at a time at separate locations.
          </p>

          <p>
            There are more things we can do with sprites.
             We can add a hover effect over the image if we want to.
              And the concept is the exact same as revealing the image.
               All we do is layer a slightly darker image when the cursor goes over said image.
                This makes the page pop more and feel a lot more interactive.
                 It gives the user something to interact with and is a nice tough to keep the user on the site and it gives an overall better browsing experience.
          </p>

          <p>So now that we know a little bit more about sprites its time to put them to use and apply them to our websites to optimize them.
             We might not see a difference with my small website but when we build large scale websites knowing about sprites and how they help make less server requests, there will be a clear difference and we will see how necessary sprites are.</p>

          <p>
            It best to get in a habit of adding them in now while still learning so we can slowly grow into larger scale websites.
