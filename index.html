        <h2>Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            “One word,” said the lawyer. “Carew was my client, but so are you,
            and I want to know what I am doing. You have not been mad enough to
            hide this fellow?”
          </p>

          <p>
            “Utterson, I swear to God,” cried the doctor, “I swear to God I will
            never set eyes on him again. I bind my honour to you that I am done
            with him in this world. It is all at an end. And indeed he does not
            want my help; you do not know him as I do; he is safe, he is quite
            safe; mark my words, he will never more be heard of.”
          </p>

          <p>
            The lawyer listened gloomily; he did not like his friend’s feverish
            manner. “You seem pretty sure of him,” said he; “and for your sake,
            I hope you may be right. If it came to a trial, your name might
            appear.”
          </p>

          <p>
            “I am quite sure of him,” replied Jekyll; “I have grounds for
            certainty that I cannot share with any one. But there is one thing
            on which you may advise me. I have--I have received a letter; and I
            am at a loss whether I should show it to the police. I should like
            to leave it in your hands, Utterson; you would judge wisely, I am
            sure; I have so great a trust in you.”
          </p>

          <p>
            “You fear, I suppose, that it might lead to his detection?” asked
            the lawyer.
          </p>

          <p>
            “No,” said the other. “I cannot say that I care what becomes of
            Hyde; I am quite done with him. I was thinking of my own character,
            which this hateful business has rather exposed.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Utterson ruminated awhile; he was surprised at his friend’s
            selfishness, and yet relieved by it. “Well,” said he, at last, “let
            me see the letter.”
          </p>

          <p>
            The letter was written in an odd, upright hand and signed “Edward
            Hyde”: and it signified, briefly enough, that the writer’s
            benefactor, Dr. Jekyll, whom he had long so unworthily repaid for a
            thousand generosities, need labour under no alarm for his safety, as
            he had means of escape on which he placed a sure dependence. The
            lawyer liked this letter well enough; it put a better colour on the
            intimacy than he had looked for; and he blamed himself for some of
            his past suspicions.
          </p>

          <p>“Have you the envelope?” he asked.</p>

          <p>
            “I burned it,” replied Jekyll, “before I thought what I was about.
            But it bore no postmark. The note was handed in.”
